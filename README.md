Turing-Machine_Simulator
========================

Turing Machine Simulator, specifically for three machines: 

Overview
--------
 This project provides a functional basic library for creating working Turing Machines. 
The current implementation requires that all state transitions be hard-coded into a TuringMachine instance.
With future iterations, this will hopefully be fixed, so as to allow TuringMachine descriptions to be loaded from XML files.
